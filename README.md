# TCGJSON
Proof of concept for expansion of MTGJSON database files to other card games such as YuGiOh, Pokemon, One Piece, etc. 
Until proper access to TCGPlayer API is established, only certain information handling is possible.
Once access to the API is granted, further formatting can occur.
UUID's will vary based on the game but will involve some combination of card game, TCGPlayer ProductId, set/block abbreviation, and set/collector number
